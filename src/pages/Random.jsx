<p  className='text-justify p-8 text-lg' >JS Bin is a tool for experimenting with web languages. In particular HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but JS Bin also supports other languages too (like Markdown, Jade and Sass).

JS Bin is ultimately a code sharing site. Along with the code, the complete output of the code is also shared with other developers, colleagues and/or students. As you type into one of the editor “panels”, you and anyone watching your bin will see the output being generated in real-time in the output panel.

There’s many features tucked away inside JS Bin, but our design principle is that everyone gets a cursor. So when you arrive for the first time, you’ll be greeted with an initial start HTML page and very little else (though you can customise your default code).</p>
